This project is a simple Netflix clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It replicates the core UI of Netflix, including a responsive homepage, movie sections, hover effects, and a clean streaming-style layout. The focus of this project is to practice front-end development, improve UI/UX skills, and understand how modern streaming interfaces are structured. JavaScript is used to add interactivity, such as sliding carousels and dynamic content rendering. While it doesn’t include backend functionality, it serves as a solid foundation for anyone learning web design and front-end development.
